# MySQL-Adventure
# 🎬 Sakila Database - MySQL Project

## 📜 Project Overview

In this project, I explored the **Sakila dataset** to boost my skills in relational databases using **MySQL Workbench**. Throughout this journey, I learnt how to:

- 🚀 **Import datasets** into **MySQL Workbench**.
- 🔗 Understand the **Types of Relationships** in relational databases:
  - 🔑 **One-to-One** Relationship,
  - 🌐 **One-to-Many** Relationship,
  - 🔄 **Many-to-Many** Relationship.
- 🧩 Learn the **key advantages of normalisation** for improving database efficiency.
- 📏 Dive into the **normal forms** (1NF, 2NF, 3NF) to reduce redundancy.
- 🔄 Use **SQL Joins** to combine data across multiple tables.
- 🖼️ Create an **EER (Enhanced Entity-Relationship) Diagram** to visually represent relationships between tables.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- 🖥️ **MySQL Workbench**: For importing and managing the Sakila dataset.
- 💻 **SQL**: Structured Query Language for querying and manipulating data.
- 🖼️ **EER Diagram**: To design and map the relationships between database tables.

## 💡 Key Concepts Explored

### 1. **Importing a Dataset into MySQL Workbench** 📥

I kicked off by importing the **Sakila dataset** into **MySQL Workbench**. This step involved setting up the database schema, tables, and ensuring that everything was structured correctly for analysis.

### 2. **Types of Relationships in Relational Databases** 🔗

Relational databases involve different types of relationships between tables. Here's a quick overview:

- 🔑 **One-to-One Relationship**: One record in a table corresponds to exactly one record in another table.
- 🌐 **One-to-Many Relationship**: A single record in one table relates to multiple records in another table.
- 🔄 **Many-to-Many Relationship**: Multiple records in one table are related to multiple records in another.

### 3. **Normalisation and Normal Forms** 📏

Normalisation helps ensure your data is well-organised and free from unnecessary duplication. Here’s what I learned about **normal forms**:

- 🥇 **First Normal Form (1NF)**: Data is broken down into atomic units (one value per field).
- 🥈 **Second Normal Form (2NF)**: Ensures all non-key attributes are fully dependent on the primary key.
- 🥉 **Third Normal Form (3NF)**: Eliminates transitive dependencies to reduce redundancy.

### 4. **Joins in SQL** 🔄

Joins allowed me to combine data from multiple tables. Here’s a summary of the types of joins I used:

- 🔍 **INNER JOIN**: Retrieves only the matching records from both tables.
- 🛠️ **LEFT JOIN**: Returns all records from the left table, with matching records from the right.
- 🛠️ **RIGHT JOIN**: Returns all records from the right table, with matching records from the left.
- 🌐 **FULL OUTER JOIN**: Returns all records when there is a match in either the left or right tables.

### 5. **Creating an EER Diagram** 🖼️

I used **EER (Enhanced Entity-Relationship) Diagrams** to visualise the relationships between the tables in the Sakila database. This helped me map out primary keys, foreign keys, and relationships with a clear, visual representation.
